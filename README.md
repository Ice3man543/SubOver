# SubOver
## Note - This project is discontinued. No more updates will be provided! Sorry!
> But something more awesome will come soon! 

Subover is a Hostile Subdomain Takeover tool originally written in python but rewritten from scratch in Golang. Since it"s redesign, it has been aimed with speed and efficiency in mind. Till date, SubOver detects 30+ services which is much more than any other tool out there. The tool uses Golang concurrency and hence is very fast. It can easily detect and report potential subdomain takeovers that exist. The list of potentially hijackable services is very comprehensive and it is what makes this tool so powerful.

## Installing

You need to have Golang installed on your machine. There are no additional requirements for this tool.

```sh
go get github.com/Ice3man543/SubOver
```

> NOTE - Do not change the location of providers.json file. Or the tool will not work.

## FAQ
**Q:** What should my wordlist look like?

**A:** Your wordlist should include a list of subdomains you"re checking and should look something like:
```
backend.example.com
something.someone.com
apo-setup.fxc.something.com
```

## Your tool sucks!

Yes, you"re probably correct. Feel free to:

- Not use it.
- Show me how to do it better.

## TODO

- Add more services :-)
- Improve the tool (There are many things that can be done :-) )

## Development

Want to contribute? Great! 

You can add more services or recommend any changes to the existing ones. Any kind of help is appreciated.
